# Kubide Sass Architecture

This will be the Sass Architecture used by Kubide based on [CSS Guidelin](http://cssguidelin.es/) by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) and [Sass Guidelin](https://sass-guidelin.es/) by [Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com/).

## v0.0.1 [Under Construction] (Copy and pasting from the original repositories to adapt them to Kubide's way or work)

This is a free project that [I](http://ignaciodenuevo.com/) maintain at work.

Now if you feel like contributing or fixing a tiny typo by opening an issue or a pull-request would be appreciated!

# Syntax & formatting

This styleguide should describe the way we want our code to look at Kubide.

We are right now 4 Front-End developers and our Front-end Lead (so we thought is time to make an architecture to make our work easier).

Same as Sass-Guideline and CSS-Guideline we would use the following.

```// Yep
.foo {
  display: block;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0 1em;
}

// Nope
.foo {
    display: block; overflow: hidden;

    padding: 0 1em;
}´´´
